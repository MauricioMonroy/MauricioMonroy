# A brief introduction

  In academia and professional life, there is an unspoken rule that one must be adept at self-promotion in order to navigate the competitive landscape. I've always found this notion somewhat disconcerting, as I believe that time is better spent on actions than on words. However, the reality of our interconnected world has made it clear that sharing one's story is not just a self-indulgent act, but a necessary one for growth and opportunity. 
 
 ## Who am I, and what am I doing here on GitHub?

  I thought I’d start by telling you a bit about myself. I’ve spent a lot of my life looking into the depths of human psychology. This journey has taught me a simple but important lesson: knowledge is a vast ocean, and we are just passengers on its surface. Despite my keen interest in the collective human experience, I've decided not to pursue a career in psychology. 
    
  I'm more interested in how the human mind works than in the specific ways it manifests in individuals. While personal stories are fascinating, I'm more interested in the underlying principles of our shared existence. After a lot of thought and with the global shift brought about by the coronavirus pandemic in mind, I decided to revisit a childhood fascination – computer science and informatics. 
    
  This field, which I had admired from afar even as I pursued psychology, suddenly became accessible through online courses and virtual learning. My goal is to land a job as a software developer. It’s a role that not only aligns with my personal interests but is also in high demand in today’s job market. 
    
  I know my age might be seen as a disadvantage when competing with younger individuals who are also eager to enter this field. However, I possess a unique set of skills and insights that are not commonly found. My ability to merge technological concepts with my psychological expertise allows me to approach problems with a nuanced perspective, particularly in scenarios where human interaction is integral. 

  ## In summary

-Passionate about Computer Science and programming. I enjoy exploring new technologies and solving complex problems through code.

-Currently diving deep into Software Analysis and Development, and I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in different areas of programming.

-Eager to collaborate on diverse programming projects, particularly those that challenge me and help me grow. Whether it's a mobile app, web development, or software tools, I'm interested!
